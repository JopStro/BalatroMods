# JoStro's Balatro Mods
A collection of a few expansion mods for Balatro.
These mods require [balamod](https://github.com/UwUDev/balamod) to work.

# Mods
You can download the mods from the [latest release](https://github.com/JopStro/BalatroMods/releases/latest)

They are as follows:

* Parrot Joker: A custom joker that randomly "mimics" your other joker's abilities
* Buffoon Deck: A custom deck that starts you off with a jumbo buffoon pack
* JoStro Pack: All the above mods in a single zip file.

# APIS
All mods require the apis provided in this repository's "apis folder".
Feel free to use them in your own mod development if you wish.

The current apis are JS_Sprite for adding custom sprite atlases and JS_Center for adding new card centers to the game.
