# JoStro's Balatro Mods
A collection of a few expansion mods for Balatro.
These mods require [balamod](https://github.com/UwUDev/balamod) to work.

# APIS
All mods require the apis provided in this repository's "apis folder".
Feel free to use them in your own mod development if you wish.

The current apis are JS_Sprite for adding custom sprite atlases and expanding the Enhancers atlas and JS_Center for adding new card centers to the game.
